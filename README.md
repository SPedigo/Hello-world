My name is Sarah and I am 23 years old. I was born and raised in Saint Louis, where I live now with my fiance. I graduated with my 
Bachelor's degree from Western Governor's University in June 2019. I am currently enrolled in a master's program for a MS in data analysis. 
I am just learning to code and work with data and am liking it so far.
